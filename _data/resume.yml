    summary: >
      Under supervision from Professor Jeffrey Siewerdsen developed
      image-guided navigation for surgical instruments in pelvic trauma surgery
      as part of the Masters Thesis research project.
    highlights:
      - "Designed and generated a training dataset with simulated guidewires on real pelvic radiographs in Python."
      - "Implemented and trained on cluster Mask R-CNN for segmentation and keypoint detection with PyTorch."
      - "Developed an algorithm for 3D correspondence of detections using a model of the imaging system geometry."
      - "Established and verified 3D instrument localization method using backprojection on cadaver and clinical data."
      - "Conducted cadaver experiments and acquired radiographs for test dataset using a C-arm."
      - "Published work at SPIE Medical Imaging 2021."
