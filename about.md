  Hi! My name is Irina Bataeva and I am a second year Masters student in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics at Johns Hopkins University. During my Masters I fell in love with robotics and for my thesis work I have been employing deep learning method to perform image-guided surigcal navigation for K-wire placement in pelvic trauma surgery.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
